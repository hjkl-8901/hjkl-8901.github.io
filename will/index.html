<title>My Last Requests</title>
<center>
    <p><h1> Bury me in my patched up black jeans and combat boots in utica if at all possible. Don't put anything cheesy on my grave marker like quotes or "a sister a daughter a mother a friend".

    <p> Make a post on any and all facebook pages and tumblr blogs i moderate informing internet friends of my death. Post a photo of my grave on my instagram.

    <p>go on soundcloud and make all private tracks and setlists public, talk to some of my musician friends for help with postmortem album releases of shit i was working on

    <p>Give my belongings to whoever wants them. Friends get priority of course. If two or more parties want the same object, none of them get it - or it must be decided by rock paper scissors.

    <p>Make sure no news sources misgender or deadname me in reports / obituaries or otherwise (assuming i am killed or commit suicide)
